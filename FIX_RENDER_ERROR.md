# 🛠️ Fix Render Build Error: requirements.txt Not Found

## ❌ The Error
```
ERROR: Could not open requirements file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'requirements.txt'
==> Build failed 😞
```

## 🔍 Root Cause
The `requirements.txt` file wasn't uploaded to your GitHub repository, so Render can't find it.

---

## ✅ Solution Options

### Option 1: Quick Fix - Upload Missing File (Recommended)

1. **Go to your GitHub repository:** `https://github.com/koushalvichare/Portfolio`

2. **Check if `requirements.txt` exists:**
   - Look for `requirements.txt` in the file list
   - If missing, continue to step 3

3. **Upload `requirements.txt`:**
   - Click **"Add file"** → **"Upload files"**
   - Drag the `requirements.txt` file from your local folder
   - **Content should be:**
   ```
   Flask==2.3.3
   python-dotenv==1.0.0
   requests==2.31.0
   google-generativeai==0.3.2
   PyPDF2==3.0.1
   gunicorn==21.2.0
   Werkzeug==2.3.7
   ```
   - **Commit message:** `Add missing requirements.txt for Render deployment`
   - Click **"Commit changes"**

4. **Render will auto-redeploy** with the fixed file!

### Option 2: Manual Render Configuration

If uploading the file doesn't work, update your Render settings:

1. **Go to Render Dashboard** → Your portfolio service
2. **Settings** → **Build & Deploy**
3. **Change Build Command to:**
   ```bash
   pip install Flask==2.3.3 python-dotenv==1.0.0 requests==2.31.0 gunicorn==21.2.0 Werkzeug==2.3.7
   ```
4. **Save** → **Manual Deploy**

---

### Option 3: Complete Re-upload

If you're still having issues:

1. **Download all files** from your local portfolio folder
2. **Create new GitHub repository**
3. **Upload ALL files** including:
   ```
   ✅ app.py
   ✅ requirements.txt  ← This is crucial!
   ✅ build.sh
   ✅ start.sh
   ✅ render.yaml
   ✅ static/ folder
   ✅ templates/ folder
   ✅ All other files
   ```
4. **Reconnect to Render** with the new repository

## 🔧 Updated Configuration

I've also updated your build script with fallback options:

### New `build.sh` (already updated):
- ✅ Checks if `requirements.txt` exists
- ✅ Shows debugging information
- ✅ Has manual package installation as fallback

### New `render.yaml` (simplified):
- ✅ Uses direct pip command instead of script
- ✅ Simpler, more reliable build process

---

## 🚀 Quick Status Check

After uploading `requirements.txt`, your Render build should show:

```
✅ ==> Running build command 'pip install -r requirements.txt'...
✅ Successfully installed Flask-2.3.3 python-dotenv-1.0.0 ...
✅ ==> Build succeeded 🎉
```

## 🎯 Environment Variables

Don't forget to set these in Render:

| Variable | Value |
|----------|-------|
| `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` | `AIzaSyBHVl_SgpzJJG39WJrlkNBtCW5EVtxmLx8` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Any random string |
| `FLASK_ENV` | `production` |
